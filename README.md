## Description
Am creating a web application where two players take turns in rolling a dice and later gives results on who is the winner
## Prerequisite
-Web browser
-Git
## Installation
1) Go to github
2) Look at repository and click Pig-Dice
3) In the Pig-Dice repo you will see a green bar written clone or download
4) Click on that and copy the link you find there
5) Use that link to open up  my project.
## Technologies used
1) I have used a couple of languages:
  a)HTML
  b)JavaSript                  
  c)jquery
2) In styling I have employed the styles.css and bootstrap.css
## Specs
1)Each player rolls the dice in turns
2)The program should return a random number from 1-6 when the roll dice button is clicked
3) It will not return a score if the dice returns 1 as the value
4)It will return equal to the value if the number is between 2
5) The program will add the scores to bring a total of 100
